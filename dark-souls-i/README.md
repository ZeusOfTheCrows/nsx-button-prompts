# Dark Souls 1/Remastered

**[link to release](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/nsx-button-prompts/releases/tag/dark-souls-i)**

thankfully this game actually allows one to change the accept/back buttons
ingame.

### to install (Remastered):
* download DSR TPUP
* unpack files from .\Texture Override to [TPUP_directory]\Texture Override
* run DSR TPUP

### to install (ptde):
* download DSFix and enable texture override
* copy png file to `[game_directory]\DATA\dsfix\tex_override`

(This is untested as I don't own ptde. I see no reason why it shouldn't work
though.)
