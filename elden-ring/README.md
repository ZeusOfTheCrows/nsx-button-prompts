# Elden Ring

as requested by [Likara7], there is also available a version optimised for
lower resolutions (e.g. crt screens), which eschews the button border in favour
of the largest glyphs possible

### to install with ModEngine 2:

### To install with UXM:

* to be honest i don't know, i don't use it
* it should work, but i haven't tested it

## dev miscellany

edited files:

* menu\hi\01_common-tpf\SB_Operating_0(, 1, 2).dds
* menu\hi\01_common-tpf\SB_KG.dds
* menu\hi\01_common-sblytbnd.dcx\GR\data\Menu\ScaleForm\SBLayout\01_Common\Hi\SB_Operating_0(, 1, 2).layout

i have no idea why the controller image has to be squished, but it works

a lot was learnt from unpacking [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/238?tab=files&file_id=3426)
