* Square/Y icon on bottom left dpad hud is in `.\menu\menu.tpf.dcx\menu08.dds`
* ZL/ZR icon for changing tabs in in-game menu is in `.\menu\menu.tpf.dcx\menu00.dds`, but I'm not sure what the other button icons in it are used for
* `.\font\dsfont24.tpf.dsx`, `.\font\eu\dsfont24.tpf.dsx`, and `.\font\na_english\dsfont24.tpf.dsx` __appear__ to be identical
* font used is sitka text
* some .dds files won't open with pretty much anything, and I don't know why.
	* these files usually open with paint.net and XnViewMP, for some reason
	* i think all files being compressed with DXT5 works fine
