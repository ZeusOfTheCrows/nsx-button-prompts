# [Nintendo Button Prompt Mods](https://zeusofthecrows.github.io/games/mods/nsx-buttons/)

![hero image](./hero.jpg)

a series of mods that add the nintendo layout controller button prompts to
games, coloured in the SNES/SFC layout colours

i find the nintendo layout more intuitive, but colours make an icon easier to
read at a glance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

---

for games without a way to change the accept/cancel buttons in menus, A/B are
the same way around as xinput, allowing one change it via steam input, rewasd,
or some other method.

feel free to request a game; but i probably won't fulfill said request unless i
already own it or plan to buy it in the future

any commits older than \~2022-08-27 are not hugely informative, as that's when
i realised i'd made enough of these to probably warrant a non-nexus mods mirror
and uploaded to github
