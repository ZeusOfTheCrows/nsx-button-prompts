# Nintendo Button Prompt Mods

![hero image](./hero.jpg)

a series of mods that add the nintendo layout controller button prompts to
games, coloured in the SNES/SFC layout colours

i find the nintendo layout more intuitive, but colours make an icon easier to
read at a glance.^[citation needed]^

feel free to request a game; but i probably won't fulfill said request unless i
already own it or plan to buy it in the future
