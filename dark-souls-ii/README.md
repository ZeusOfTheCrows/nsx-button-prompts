**[link to release](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows/nsx-button-prompts/releases/tag/dark-souls-ii)**

### To install (iPG11):

* Unpack files from `.\tex_override` to `[game_directory]\Game\iGP11\tex_override`

### To install (manually):

* Download no-igp11 file, and unpack from .\font\ to [game_directory]\Game\font\

(This version may work with non-sotfs, but it's untested)

## dev miscellany

* [use this for unpacking](https://github.com/horkrux/DeS-BNDBuild/releases)
* Font used is sitka text
* In the small file, the flipped A B are used for various in-UI buttons. wWhy are they flipped? Who knowsâ€¦
* iGP11 tex_overrides have to have all four files to work properly, I don't know why
* Location of pertinent files is:
	* `.\font\[language]\FeFont_Big.fontbnd.dcx\FeFont_Big.fontbnd\FeFont_Big_0000_win64.tpf\FeFont_Big_0000_win64.dds`
	* `.\font\[language]\FeFont_Small.fontbnd.dcx\FeFont_Small.fontbnd\FeFont_Small_0000_win64.tpf\FeFont_Small_0000_win64.dds`
